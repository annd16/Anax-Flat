About me
--------

This is my me-webpage in the dbwebb course [design](https://dbwebb.se/kurser/design), and this page gives a very brief presentation of me.

My name is Anna and I have earlier studied within the area of natural science. After I finished my studies,
I've worked for several years within the manufacturing industry.

I have always had an interest in computers and in programming, so at the moment I'm really
enjoying learning how to program for the web, and I'm looking forward to indulge in this art for the next couple of years!
