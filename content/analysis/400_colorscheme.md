Color scheme
------------
<div class="analysis" markdown=1>

Three  websites have been analyzed in point of which colour palette, colour scheme and font-families they're using.

I have tried to find web pages that either fits into a known colour scheme, or that I have found interesting in some way.  

I have used [Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) and [Paletton](http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF) for my analyzes.
Adobe Color CC (Kuler) seems to use the CMYK wheel (where green is opposite mangenta) and Paletton seems to use the RYB wheel (Red-Yellow-Blue) that is used by traditional artists.

###**Web page \#1: [The police](https://polisen.se/)**

<img src="img/polisen2_paint.jpg" alt="Screen dump" class="">


**Color palette:**  
<section class="table">
    <div class="tr">
        <div id="id11" class="td">C1</div>
        <div id="id12" class="td">C2</div>
        <div id="id13" class="td">C3</div>
        <div id="id14" class="td">C4</div>
        <div id="id15" class="td">C5</div>
        <div id="id16" class="td">C6</div>
    </div>
</section>


**Color scheme:** First I thought it was either monochromatic (with blue as the primary colour and yellow as accent colour) OR Complementary (colours from opposite each other in the colour wheel) if the CMYK colour wheel is used, but then I saw the green borders, and then perhaps it might be classified as analogous (with colours that are adjacent to each other in colour wheel).


**Accent Color:**           <div class="tr inline">
                                <div id="id1A" class="td">A</div>
                            </div>  


**Font-families:** The website seems to use the following font-families: `Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif` (for headlines, 'bread text', links etc), the only exception to this - that I have seen at least - is in the forms where the following families have been used: `Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif`. Sans-serif seems to be the dominant font-type on the website.

**Comments:** The background colours used on the website are white and grey. The dominant 'active' colours are two shades of blue. Yellow and green is used for top-borders. This sparsely colour scheme, I believe, suits an authority that is supposed to be respectable, trustworthy and make the citizens feel safe.
The blue colour signals (according to 'The Principles of Beautiful Web design' at least) openness, stability and faith.

###**Web page \#2: [ICA](https://www.ica.se/)**

<!-- Originalstorleken på bilden: 238x300px -->  
<img src="img/ica_paint.jpg" alt="Screen dump" class="">

**Color palette:**  
<section class="table">
<div class="tr">
    <div id="id21" class="td">C1</div>
    <div id="id22" class="td">C2</div>
    <div id="id23" class="td">C3</div>
    <div id="id24" class="td">C4</div>
    <div id="id25" class="td">C5</div>
    <div id="id26" class="td">C6</div>
</div>
</section>


**Color scheme:**  
Most of the pages on the website follow an analogous colour scheme i.e. they have colours that are adjacent to each other in the colour wheel (purple, red, rose/pink).

**Accent Color:**       &nbsp; &nbsp; `None`


**Font-families:**  
The website uses 'homemade' font families (all seems to be sans-serif). Here are some examples:  body: `icatext, Arial, sans-serif`, h1: `icarubrik`, h2: `icarubrik/icatext`, p: `icatext, sans-serif`, ‘handwritten text': `icahand, icassn, Arial`.

**Comments:**   
I think they have made a somewhat odd choice of colours for the homepage. All these different shades of rose and pink in combination with the bright red colour grates on me. And foremost, the colour scheme doesn't make me think of food, which is the company's main sales product. Even though the web designer(s) of this web page most likely have been pinioned by the colours of the ICA-logo/cards (bright red and rose), they could perhaps have skipped the purple and combined the colours somewhat differently. As an example: when hovering over the red-purple links their colour turns into a strong pink colour, almost cerise, which doesn't match either the purple main colour nor the pale rose colour that is used as background to icons and link texts.

###**Web page \#3: [Wedholms fisk](https://wedholmsfisk.se/)**

<!-- <div class="analysis"></div> -->

<img src="img/wedholmsfisk_paint.jpg" alt="Screen dump" class="">

**Color palette:**  
<section class="table">
<div class="tr">
    <div id="id31" class="td">C1</div>
    <div id="id32" class="td">C2</div>
    <div id="id33" class="td">C3</div>
    <div id="id34" class="td">C4</div>
    <div id="id35" class="td">C5</div>
    <div id="id36" class="td">C6</div>
</div>

</section>


**Color scheme:**   
The website uses a monochromatic colour scheme, with #A9A9A1 as the base colour (the background-colour in the body-element).


**Accent Color:**       &nbsp; &nbsp; `None`


**Font-families:**   
The headings (h1-h3 at least) is `Times New Roman, Times , serif`. The "bread text" (p-element) is `Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif`

**Comments:**   
I find this website very appealing, the sober appearance with grey and white colours, which lets the photos speak for themselves, and the 'soft' colours on the photos, is suitable to promote food I think (and the slight tinge of rose in the photos will at least lead my thoughts to salmon which of course is very suitable for a restaurant specialized in dishes based on fish).
